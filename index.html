        <p>Hello! My name is Adrian Bello and I am from Brazil. I moved to USA 10 years ago and I
            live in the
            Boston area. I like to do sports; I go to the gym almost every day and in summer I run
            and go
            mountain biking. I love to eat foods from different countries, like Brazilian, Mexican
            and Chinese.
            I am studying Software Development, and I am really motivated to get my degree and start
            working. </p>
