        <p>Hello! My name is Adrian Bello and I am from Brazil. I moved to USA 10 years ago and I
            live in the
            Boston area. I like to do sports; I go to the gym almost every day and in summer I run
            and go
            mountain biking. I love to eat foods from different countries, like Brazilian, Mexican
            and Chinese.
            I am studying Software Development, and I am really motivated to get my degree and start
            working. </p>

        <p> Curitiba is the capital of Paraná in southern Brazil and is known for its modern urban
            planning,
            efficient public transportation, and strong focus on sustainability. The city has a mild
            climate,
            many green spaces, and a diverse cultural background influenced by European immigration,
            making it a
            well-organized and high-quality place to live.</p>
